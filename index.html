        Erin,
        <br><br>
        Hello. <!--okay okay, i'll add comments here. siguro to add context na rin? wala eh, gaya gaya ako. eme. ahahaha. might add and edit 
        things here rin every now and then, depende kung ano maisip ko hahaha--> 
        <br><br>
        First of all, welcome to my GitHub. I know—it's underwhelming. There's not much here, and honestly, I rarely use it. But for some reason, 
        it felt like the right place to leave this. Well, nah, I just copied the idea off of you. Hahaha. <!--gaya gaya na nga. also i know, compsci
        ako pero 'di pala gamit ng github. wala eh, i'm not really as organized with my projects.. but maybe when i have time (or when i feel forced)
        ilalagay ko na dito projects ko..or not. maybe in a different account. i don't want to freak my employers out-->
        <br><br>
        I've been thinking about you these past few days. But to say just these past few days would be dishonest. <!--teh, gabi-gabi na lang kita napapanaginipan. masyado kang halata with your witchcraft. 
        won't tell you the context of those dreams though! unless you tell yours first mwehehe -->
        The truth is, you cross my mind every day. Sometimes in fleeting flashes, sometimes in waves that drown me. You show up in quiet hours, in songs I used to love, 
        in places I've walked a hundred times before. Sometimes, you're a song I thought I forgot. Minumulto mo ba ako? Ahahaha maybe. It wouldn't 
        surprise me. That song—Multo by Cup of Joe—just adds salt to the wound. And those edits, god, they made it worse. Fuck those edits, for real. 
        They opened something I've been trying to keep shut. <!--napanuod mo na ba ang Past Lives? and also Your Name Engraved Herein? i highly suggest that
        you watch them. that's all i have to say skdfhsk-->
        <br><br>
        This is my way of giving poetical justice to what remains inside me—something heavy and unresolved. <!--sige na nga kasi-->
        <br><br>
        Meeting you changed the course of my life. I don't say that lightly. You were one of the first people 
        who truly saw me, who knew how to look beyond the surface and listen between my silences. I think about the little 
        things—like that time in 7th grade when we bought ice cream in the hallway connecting the LCC buildings. Do you remember that? I do.
        <!--if you cannot recall, we bought ice cream from mcdo. it had strawberry jam and we laughed about how it looked like period blood
        SKDFDSKJ girl ewan ko rin kung bakit pero core memory ko talaga 'yan. it's a shame they don't sell that same ice cream anymore-->
        Vividly. Every time I walk through that hall, I still half-expect to see you there, laughing about something dumb, holding the world 
        in your hands like it was yours for the taking. I don't just see you—I see us. I feel that version of myself that only ever existed when 
        I was with you. Actually, I feel like that with the entirety of Tabaco. Every moment still lives in me. Our shared memories are so vivid 
        and precious to me. They are a part of who I am, and they connect me to you in a way that nothing else can.
        <br><br>
        It's truly a shame that we lost what we lost. And lately, I've lost hope of rebuilding whatever we had. I look at our current circumstances, 
        and I can't help but wonder if we're too far apart now—too different. But I don't want to lose hope just yet. I don't think I can. I keep 
        coming back to the idea that we were meant for something in this lifetime, and I don't want to lose that only chance. Not yet. <!--i am so full
        of regret-->
        <br><br>
        It hurts to think about what we lost. And I'll take the blame for it. We used to be inseparable. We had that rare friendship that felt like 
        home—like we'd known each other in another life and just found our way back. I trusted you with the darkest corners of my mind. I told you things I couldn't 
        even say out loud to myself. We dreamed together. We believed in the future, even when the present was falling apart. There was comfort in that. And I let it go. 
        I let you go. I acknowledge the mistakes I made that led to our separation. I understand the pain I caused, and I carry that with me every day.
        <br><br>
        I still wrestle with what I feel about you. I'm constantly pulled between wanting to forget and being terrified that I'll actually succeed in 
        doing so. These days, I find myself stuck in a loop—oscillating between denial and acceptance, between moving on and reaching back. That's why I put 
        that stupid ass sentence in that playlist. I needed the lie to feel true, even if only for a moment. But I saw your comments today—April 11—and 
        I'm sorry it took me this long to acknowledge them. The truth is, that playlist was always about you. Every song, every title, every pause between 
        tracks. All of it.
        <br><br>
        That's also why I didn't come out when you last visited. I heard you were there. I knew it. But I couldn't bring myself to step out. Because what I
        felt for you in that moment felt almost criminal. I have Danelle, and I love her in the way I know how. <!--a friend agreed with me that it is
        truly a shame. that to be able to be with one of you, i have no choice but to accept the inevitability that i will have to lose the other.
        i wish danelle would understand. kaya nga 'di an ako sumipot sa'yo, 'di an nagpapansin. kasi si danelle, 'di ko kayang saktan-->
        But you? You've always existed in a part of me untouched by time or logic. And that terrified me. I didn't know how to compare what I felt for either of you. I still don't. But one 
        thing remains true through all of it: I loved you. And everything we shared was real. No version of the future, no rewriting of the past, 
        will ever make that any less true.
        <br><br>
        Anne Carson wrote, <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/107999-why-does-tragedy-exist-because-you-are-full-of-rage" target="_blank">"Why does tragedy exist? 
        Because you are full of rage. Why are you full of rage? Because you are full of grief."</a></em> And I think that's what this is, really. Grief disguised 
        as nostalgia. Longing, tangled with guilt. I've spent so much time trying not to feel it, trying to write around it, laugh through it, 
        bury it under distractions and distance, that I forgot how heavy unspoken things can become, how they press down on your chest in quiet 
        moments, when a song comes on, or when you pass by places that used to mean something—used to tell us. I am not angry at you. 
        I think that's important to say. But I do feel this rage sometimes—a low-burning kind—that I now understand isn't about blame but grief. 
        Grief that we let it all slip, that I let you slip. That we used to be something solid, and now we're more of a memory than anything else. 
        There's a helplessness in that realization that has followed me into every version of myself since.
        <br><br>
        I don't know if this is a letter, a confession, or just an attempt to release what's been stuck inside me for too long. But what I do know is 
        that silence hasn't worked. And no matter how much I try to pretend I've moved past this, past us, I find myself returning—again and 
        again—to these same feelings, just in different forms. <!--antagal ko talaga itong kinimkim, almost five years skjfhs-->
        <br><br>
        I've been reading again—mostly because of you. Who would've thought? Between us, I was the bookworm. Look at how time has changed us.
        <!--it truly amazes me how much you've changed, i don't think i was able to tell you this the last time we spoke. but i am, truly. 
        i am so proud of you--> I picked up a few books just to feel something again. And then I found myself reading Carl Jung, well, because of you, trying to 
        make sense of the psyche, of shadows and selves I've ignored for too long. It's strange how the process of healing feels like digging 
        up old bones. But you made me want to know myself again. Somehow, you always have.
        <br><br>
        And then there's poetry. It has slowly become a language I return to when my own words fail me. Mary Oliver once wrote, 
        <em><a href="https://brettmilam.com/2020/11/26/mary-olivers-poem-the-uses-of-sorrow/" target="_blank">"Someone I loved once gave me / a box full of darkness. 
        / It took me years to understand / that this, too, was a gift."</a></em> I'm not saying our story was dark—not at all. In fact, it was light. 
        It was warmth, wild laughter, and connection, so rare that I still question whether they were even real. But the loss of you—the absence that came after, 
        the quiet that replaced our conversations, the way time swallowed up what we used to be—that was darkness. A kind of soft mourning that never quite 
        announced itself. It didn't scream. It settled. Quietly. Gently. But heavy all the same. For a long time, I tried to leave that box untouched. 
        I kept it somewhere in the back of my mind, sealed shut, convinced that whatever it held would undo me. But I've started to open it lately. Carefully. Slowly. 
        Through books, through letters I don't send, through thoughts I whisper only to myself. The strange thing is that I'm starting to see 
        what Mary Oliver meant. That even pain, when held gently and examined honestly, can become a form of clarity. A gift—not in the way 
        you'd want or ask for, but in the way it forces you to see yourself more truthfully. To grow. Losing you gave me that kind of mirror. 
        And it hurt like hell, but it also asked me to be honest about who I am and who I've been to the people I love. 
        It taught me that regret is not just an ache—it's a call. To look back, not to stay stuck, but to learn how to walk forward differently. 
        And maybe that's what the gift is. Not forgetting, not numbing, but learning how to live with what happened and still find beauty in the fact 
        that it happened at all.
        <br><br>
        I'm sorry, Erin. For the silence. For the distance. For making you feel like you were easy to forget when, in truth, forgetting you has 
        been impossible. I still don't understand how you found it in you to forgive me—how you still see something worth holding onto. But I'm thankful. Deeply.
        <br><br>
        I live in Legazpi now. I still go home, but I spend most of my days here. I don't spend as much time in Tabaco anymore. The city feels 
        different when your memories live in its corners. I see you in the spaces we could've filled—with more time, more stories, more softness. 
        More healing. Sometimes, I walk through the market or sit by the seawall, and suddenly, you're there—in the way the wind moves, in the way someone laughs. 
        I tell myself it's just a coincidence, but deep down, I know better. Maybe it's karma. Perhaps it's just the universe reminding me of what I lost.
        <!--parati ko nakikita pinsan mo sa CS dkfjsj fack et talaga. it's so awkward every time we make eye contact. he's truly a living proof of my karma,
        kasi every time nakikita ko siya, ikaw naalala ko. and imagine that. i see him sa CS almost every day-->
        <br><br>
        Lately, I've been learning how to drive. I usually practice near the Malilipot seawall or take the bypass road—whatever you call it. 
        The place where we last saw each other. That's where I'm working on my turns. If you ever see a small white Hyundai Eon crawling along at 
        10km/h, that's probably me. <--doing allat just to catch a glimpse of you-->
        <br><br>
        I wish we could talk again. Not to fix things, not to force anything back into what it used to be—just to speak. To hear your voice again, 
        even for a moment. There's something sacred in the simplicity of that. I still carry so many thoughts that I don't know how to say them out 
        loud. Feelings that live in the quietest corners of me, untouched because they felt too tender, too complicated, too late.
        <br><br>
        This—whatever this is—might be the only way I know how to let them breathe. To say the things I never permitted myself to speak. Maybe this 
        is my way of reaching out one last time, or perhaps it's just me trying to unburden a heart that has held too much in silence.
        <br><br>
        And I'm sorry—truly. For all the ways I failed you. For the distance I created, for the confusion I left you with, for the parts of me you 
        had to carry when I should've been the one holding space for you. I know I've hurt you, and I don't expect anything from this except the chance to finally say: 
        I see that now. And I regret it.
        <br><br>
        You meant more to me than I ever let on—more than I knew how to say, maybe even more than I understood at the time.
